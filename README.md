- 👋 Hi, I’m @v-stthomas -- a.k.a. Steven Thomas, Cat Butler, Max Pithecus.
- 👀 I’m interested in helping people make good use of online resources. I'm also interested in learning to develop using MSFT Cloud products. I was primairly responsible for publishing the Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit Dynamics 365 content, and for the Configure node of Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare's Sync Admin for FHIR, although I did get raw source material from PMs in both cases. It was still an accomplish I'm proud of. I recently finished content and some videos the first release of Microsoft Cloud for Retail Dynamics 365 Solution, Unified customer profile featuring the Retail channel chnurn model (it uses standard Customer Insights dataset unification techniques, but it has no commonm data model, so it presents some challenges but can add value to anyone with a entrprise retail business.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how Dynamics 365 Industry Solutions does things, including its intersection with Azure and Dataverse.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where my team needs me.
- 📫 How to reach me ... email to v-stthomas@microsoft.com works for the next few weeks. After that, email to wemilo@hotmail.com, stevenbentleythomas@yahoo.com, wemilo@maxpithecus.onmicrosoft.com, or wh4tev4@live.com should all be feasible for the foreseeable future.
- My time working on Microsoft Cloud Solutions based on Dynamics 365 is drawing to a close, but I'll still be on GitHub, developing a philosophy repo called Way Calm.
